Outer Space News is a simple project in progress that is designed to aggregate popular RSS feeds with space and science as their main topics. These are sourced from government, businesses, and private news sources. I also plan on having live data for upcoming space launches, who is in space currently and upcoming events such as eclipses, meteor showers and comets. Thanks for checking out my first public project!
